<!-- I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at The University of Chicago advised by [Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/) in the [Chicago Human+AI Lab](https://chicagohai.github.io/). My research interests include human-centered AI, natural language processing, interpretability, and machine learning for healthcare. Previously, I graduated, also from UChicago, with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.  -->

I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student in the [Chicago Human+AI Lab](https://chicagohai.github.io/) at the University of Chicago advised by [Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/). My research aims at understanding large language models (their mechanisms, decision-making, biases) and how they can help us understand complex systems such as the physical world. I am also excited about the prospects of AI in healthcare and have done some work in this area.

<!-- In my free time you can find me in the weight room, running outside, practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, or just watching a good movie. I am also a big fan of the cold weather and a beginner skier! If you think we have similar interests and would like to chat about research or collaborate, please feel free to reach out. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
