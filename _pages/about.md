I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at The University of Chicago advised by [Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/) in the [Chicago Human+AI Lab](https://chicagohai.github.io/). My research interests include human-centered AI, natural language processing, interpretability, and deep learning for healthcare. Previously, I graduated, also from UChicago, with a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. 

In my free time you can find me in the weight room, practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, or just reading a good book. I am also a big fan of cold weather and prefer to spend vacations on snowy mountains rather than sunny beaches. If you think we have similar interests and would like to chat about research, please feel free to reach out!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
